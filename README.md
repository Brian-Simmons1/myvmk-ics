# 🗓️ MyVMK Events Calendar via .ics

You can subscribe to this calendar using any calendar app to integrate the MyVMK Events directly into your native calendar app. It automatically updates daily (but depends on your calendar's refresh for subscribed calendars).  
This calendar is generated by a Python script that scrapes the official [MyVMK Events page](https://www.myvmk.com/events) every day and publishes a live `.ics` file that you can subscribe to in **Google Calendar**, **Apple Calendar**, or **Outlook**.

---

## 💡 How it works

- The script (`myvmk-cal.py`) runs automatically once a day on GitHub Actions.
- It fetches the current event list from the official MyVMK site.
- It converts all events into a standard **ICS calendar file** (`myvmk.ics`).
- The calendar is hosted right here on GitHub Pages and updates automatically.
- You can subscribe to it — and your calendar app will always stay up to date!

## 🔄 Update schedule

This calendar automatically refreshes **once per day** at 8:00 AM UTC (3–4 AM Eastern).  
If new events are posted on MyVMK, they’ll appear after the next update.  
Google Calendar and others may take a few hours to show the latest version (normal for subscribed calendars).

## 🧠 Notes & FAQ

**Can I add my own events?**  
Not directly to the subscribed calendar — it’s read-only.  
If you want to add personal reminders, create another calendar in your app and layer it on top.

**Is this official?**  
Nope! This is a fan-made project for convenience. All event data comes from the public MyVMK website.

**How can I help?**  
If you notice missing or incorrect events, open an issue or PR on this repository.  
The script runs daily and can easily be tweaked if MyVMK changes their site layout.
